# Setting up your environment

Disclamer: these steps work on Linux, and usually on OSX. Windows is not yet supported.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to where you want the DNA folder to go
2. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/X-The-Mystic/DNA.git`. This will download the DNA source code
3. Move into the DNA directory
4. run the command `make`. If you get a _command not found_ error, you may need to install make or g++.
5. If all goes well, after a few seconds you should end up with a DNA executable in your current directory called `DNA`.
6. Run it with the command `./DNA path/to/DNA/source.dna`. If you don't have any DNA source code yet, test it with `./DNA examples/hello_world.dna`
7. If it works, you can now move on to the "basic concepts" tutorial
